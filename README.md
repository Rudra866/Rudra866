### 🌌 About Me
"Innovation isn't just a goal; it's desire, passion and will to create something new!"
I'm a Computer Science Honours student. I thrive in designing efficient systems, solving problems, and creating tools that elevate user experiences. Whether it's distributed systems, AI/ML models, or operating systems, I aim to leave a mark on every line of code I write.
